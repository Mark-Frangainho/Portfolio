            <p className="about-myself">My name is Mark Frangainho. I'm a full-stack developer who loves the different challenges on both sides of development. Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active through sports especially soccer and when I want to chill out, gaming helps ease the mind. My current focus in developement is working on improving my frontend skills and my backend skills. I'm early in my developement career but im always looking for ways to improve my craft.</p>
